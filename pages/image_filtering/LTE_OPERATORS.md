# LINEAR AND TRANSLATION EQUIVARIANT FILTERS

## LINEARITY

given a 2D input signal $i(x,y)$ an operator $T(i(x,y)): T(i(x,t))=o(x,y)$ is linear if the filter of a linear combination is equal to the output of the filters of the single elements

$$
T(ai_{1}(x,y)+bi_{2}(x,y)) =ao_{1}(x,y) + bo_{2}(x,y) \space with
$$
$$
o_{1}(.)=T(i_{1}(.)), \space o_{2}(.)=T(i_{2}(.)) \space b,y \in R
$$

## TRANSLATION EQUIVARIANCY

an operator $T(i(x,y)): T(i(x,t)=o(x,y)$ is said to be translation equivariant if the output of the filter given an image with translated coordinates is the same as the output of the filter for that given points

$$
T(i(x-x_{0},y-y_{0})) = o(x-x_{0},y-y_{0})
$$

## CONVOLUTION

If this conditions are met then the output of the operator is given by the **convolution** between the input signal and the impulse response (kernel) of the operator.

$$
o(x,y) = T(i(x,y)) = \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}{\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}{i(\alpha,\beta)h(x-\alpha,y-\beta)d\alpha d\beta}} \space with
$$
$$
h(x,y) = T(\delta(x,y))
$$

### PROPERTIES

The convolution $o(x,y)= i(x,y)\ast h(x,y)$ benefits from the following properties

| PROPERTY                        | FORMULA                                   |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| associative                     | $f\ast(g\ast h)= (f\ast g) \ast h$        |
| commutative                     | $f\ast g = g\ast f$                       |
| distributive wrt to the sum     | $f\ast(g + h) =f\ast g + f\ast h$         |
| commutative wrt differentiation | $(f\ast g)^{'}= f^{'}\ast g =f\ast g^{'}$ |

## CORRELATION

correlation of a signal $i(x,y)$ with respect to a signal $h(x,y)$ is defined as follows

$$
i(x,y)\circ h(x,y) = \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}{\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}{i(\alpha,\beta)h(x+\alpha,y+\beta)d\alpha d\beta}} \space with
$$

**CORRELATION IS NOT COMMUTATIVE**

## CONVOLUTION AND CORRELATION RELATION

Convolution and correlation are similar to each other, they both integrate a product of 2 functions after translation (but correlation does not do reflection), it's worth to notice that if the $h(x,y)$ function is even the 2 functions are equal:

$$
\displaylines{i(x,y)\ast h(x,y) =h(x,y)\ast i(x,y) = \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}{\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}{i(\alpha,\beta)h(x-\alpha,y-\beta)d\alpha d\beta}} = \\
\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}{\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}{i(\alpha,\beta)h(\alpha-x,\beta - y)d\alpha d\beta}} = \\
h(x,y)\circ i(x,y)}
$$

Remember that **correlation is not commutative** even if h is even

## DISCRETE CONVOLUTION

In a real scenario the image is a discrete representation, in order to account for this the convolution function is translated in a discrete form

$$
O(i,j) = T(I(i,j)) = \sum_{m=-\infty}^{+\infty}{\sum_{n=-\infty}^{+\infty}{I(m,n)H(i-m,j-n)}} \space with
$$
$$
H(i,j) = T(\delta(i,j))
$$

In this representation the input and the output function are real image signals representations and the $H(i,j)$ is the discrete representation of the kernel function (e.g. the kronecker delta function)

This model it's not feasible for implementation as images are stored on matrix of finite sizes

$$
O(i,j) = \sum_{m=-k}^{+k}{\sum_{n=-k}^{+k}{K(m,n)I(i-m,j-n)}} \space with
$$

So the idea behind the implementation is to slide the kernel matrix over the image and compute the convolution for each point of the image
