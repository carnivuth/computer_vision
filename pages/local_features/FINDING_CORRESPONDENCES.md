# FINDING CORRESPONDENCES

A lot of computer vision problems can be dealt with finding the correspondences between two images, The process can be described as follows

A[DETECTION]
B[DESCRIPTION]
C[MATCHING]
A --> B
B --> C
```

Where:

- in detection phase interesting point of an image are detected (**keypoints**)
- in description phase for each keypoint a descriptor based on the neighborhood is computed
- in the matching phase descriptors of keypoints detected from a reference image are compared against descriptors of keypoint from different images

The algorithms for the detection and description phase must have the following properties

| DETECTORS                                                                                                                  | DESCRIPTORS                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| **REPEATABILITY**<br><br>it should find the same keypoint in the image despite the transformations undergone by the images | **DISTINCTIVENESS/ROBUSTNESS TRADE OFF**<br><br>it should capture the salient information in the neighborhood of  a keypoint and also avoid noise effects from change of light intensities<br> |
| **INTERESTINGNESS**<br><br>It should find points with informative surroundings as to enable the matching process           | **COMPACTNESS**<br><br>description should be concise as possible in order to improve the matching process                                                                                      |
## KEYPOINTS

keypoints are points that contains the most information in an image, [edges](EDGES.md) are bad candidates as **along the perpendicular direction they are pretty similar and cannot be distinguished**, points that show high variance in all directions are best suited for the purpose such as corners
