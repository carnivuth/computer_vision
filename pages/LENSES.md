- a scene point is on focus when all light rays from that point it the camera in the same point of the image plane
- in a pinhole camera is always true because of the small size of the image 
- but to collect enough light to produce an image exposition time must be long and the image must be static to avoid motion blur
- camera relies on lens to gather the light in a single point 
- with lens there is no infinite depth fields

## THIN LENS EQUATION

- Due to this equation to catch point of a certain distance on focus we need to adjust the position of the image plane accordingly
- points farther or closer than the focus distance will appear out-of-focus **Blur-circles**

- if **BLUR CIRCLES** are smaller then the size of the photosensing elements the points still look on focus this range of distance is called DOF (depth of field)
- to adjust focus camera also have a mechanism that translate the lens along the optical axis
