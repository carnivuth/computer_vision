# INSTANCE LEVEL OBJECT DETECTION

Instance level object detection is a common problem in computer vision industrial application, it can be formulated as follows:

*given a reference image called model image of a specific object find  the correspondences in another image called target image, in case of detection, output detect the pose of the object in the target image*

The problem can be declined in many variants, for example the object can appear multiple times in the target image and there can be multiple of them

Typical problems to address in this situation are intensity changes, rotation and occlusion
