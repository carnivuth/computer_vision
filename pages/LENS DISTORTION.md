- the PPM is based on the pinhole camera model that can't model the effect due to lens distortion,

- the most known distortion are
	-  #RADIAL_DISTORTION distortion due to lens curvature
	- #TANGENTIAL due to misalignment  of optical components

the model adopted to account for lens distortion is

- lens distortion is defined in function of distance from distortion center
