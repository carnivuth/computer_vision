# BLOB ANALISYS

after detecting blobs the next step is to compute features which are properties computed on blocks

## barycentre and area

## orientation

the orientation is the angle $\sigma$  between major axis and horizontal axis

## ORIENTED BOUNDING BOX

given the major and minor axis the oriented bounding box can be compute

the points `c1,c2c3,c4` needed to be computed in order to obtain the dimension of the bounding box

with the [OBB](#ORIENTED%20BOUNDING%20BOX) we can obtain length and width of the object defined as  
```
L = extent of the object along major axis
W = extent of the  object along minor axis
```

# LOCAL FEATURES 

## EDGES

points where there is a change in the contrast of the image

operators that detect pixels are filter that classifies edge points and not edge point 

filter can be implemented with a derivative function to detect changes in contrast

## 2D EDGES

2D edges cannot be computed with directional derivative so we need to use the gradient of the image

the gradient need to be approssimate

but these approximations are too simple and does not work in real case appliances
