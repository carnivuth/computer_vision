# BYNARIZATION BY INTENSITY TRESHOLDING

inherently binary images can be classified by a shareholding operator with a suitable threshold 

![](Pasted%20image%2020231102114149.png)

in some cases is needed to compute for each image a threshold because light condition are not guaranteed 

several approaches:

- use mean value as threshold 
	works when values are evenly distributed

### OTSU'S ALGORITHM

algorithm for threshold automatic computation, it divides the image in two continuous regions and chose the optimal threshold in order to minimize the within-group variance

## ADAPTIVE THRESHOLDING

needed when lighting isn't uniform across the scene, it computes a binarization threshold for each pixel of the image based on neighborhood 

trade off between **big neighborhood** and **computational power** required to calculate the threshold

to calculate trashold: mean, gaussian mean or median are used 

# COLOUR BASED THRESHOLDING

needed in images where objects exhibit a known color different from background
