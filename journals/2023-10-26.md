# FILTERING IMAGES

## MEAN FILTER

[LTE OPERATOR](LTE%20OPERATORS.md)

- simple filter that consist to replace all pixel intensity values with the mean of a chosen neighborhood 
- mean filter carries out a low pass filter operation
- can be implemented by box filtering, an incremental calculation scheme

- effective against gaussian noise but blurs the image
- not effective against pulse noise and blurs the image


## GAUSSIAN FILTER

[LTE OPERATOR](LTE%20OPERATORS.md) whit an inpulse response of a 2D gaussian function whit 0 mean and constant diagonal covariance matrix

it's needed to use a kernel that includes all the energy of the gaussian function, but larger kernels makes the filter computation much expensive

### rule of thumb 

usa a (2k+1)Ã—(2k+1)kernel with k=3sigma
