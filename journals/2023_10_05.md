# NOISE 
- this is a big problem for computer vision
- de-noising image is a big topic
# COLORS
- obtained by installed an optical filter in front of the sensors so the sensor can get only a portion of the light wavelengths

- for each pixel the other wavelengths are guessed by the neighbour pixels (demosaking)
-  for a full resolution of the color is possible to use a colored sensor

# PERSPECTIVE PROJECTION
![](../assets/Pasted%20image%2020231005122554.png)
- the equation to map a 3D point to a 2D coordinate are as follow
```
u=f/z*x
v=f/z*y
```

## PROJECTIVE SPACE P^3
- in the 3D euclidean space we can't rappresent a point that is infinitly distant from the image 
- paralel lines do not intersect

### PROJECTIVE COORDINATES
 - a point is rappresented by a quadruplet of number which
 `(x y z 1)=(2x 2y 2z 2)=(kx ky kz k) for each k !=0`
 - so a point as a class of rappresentation  vectors 
### point at infinity of a line

- setting lambda to infinity:
![](../assets/Pasted%20image%2020231005124238.png)

- in a P^3 space rappresentation the point at the infinity is rappresented by a  vector parallel to the line and adding a 0 as a fourth coordinate
## Perspective Projection in projective coordinates
- if we translate the image reference system and the real world reference system to P^2 and P^3
![](../assets/Pasted%20image%2020231005125731.png)
- now the perspective projection become a linear transformation
![](../assets/Pasted%20image%2020231005125827.png)
- in matrix notation
`km=PM`
