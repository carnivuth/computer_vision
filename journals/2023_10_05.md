# NOISE 
- this is a big problem for computer vision
- de-noising image is a big topic
# COLORS
- obtained by installed an optical filter in front of the sensors so the sensor can get only a portion of the light wavelengths

- for each pixel the other wavelengths are guessed by the neighbour pixels (demosaking)
-  for a full resolution of the color is possible to use a colored sensor
