# STEREO REFERENCE FRAME

- 
- the standard solution is to refer to a one of the 2 cameras and describe the other camera as a translation and rotation from the first camera so the first camera became the #WRF
- so PPM of the second camera became a translation and rotation of the #WRF

## RECTIFICATION

 - real stereo cameras are difficult to work with due to phisical imperfection and mechanical imperfection
 - the solution is to define a pair of virtual cameras and then rectifing the images by a rotation using [HOMOGRAPHY](PERSPECTIVE%20PROJECTION.md#P%20AS%20A%20HOMOGRAPHY)
 - the virtual cameras are created by #warping the images from the phisical cameras 
 - this needed to be done after [LENS DISTORTION](PERSPECTIVE%20PROJECTION.md#LENS%20DISTORTION) correction

## NEW PPMs

- Given `AL, AR, R, T` the new PPMs can be achieved as follows


## RECTIFICATION HOMOGRAPHIES

- both camera rotate along the optical center so images are related by [HOMOGRAPHIES](PERSPECTIVE%20PROJECTION.md#P%20AS%20A%20HOMOGRAPHY)

- this has something to do with #warping
